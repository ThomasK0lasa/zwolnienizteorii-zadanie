# Zwolnieni z Teorii - zadanie

## About App
- By coincidence I found a memory leak bug in router. As I don't like bugs I fixed it as best as I could even that it wasn't part of this assignment.
- I used kebab-case in CSS and camelCase in JS.
- I used fetch for API fetching but I like axios more.
- I found additional points ;) - 'Dodatkowe punkty za sprawdzenie tokenu! Wspomnij o tym na rozmowie ;)'
- This app definitely could use some middleware as for authorization and protected pages but I went with simple redirect function
